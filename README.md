# Ukraine's Black Earth and Forests

Growing up attending Ukrainian school every Saturday, I would learn, over and over again, about the fertile, black earth of Ukraine. The country is the "bread basket of Europe," after all. And that wasn't just cultural pride speaking: the soil even has its own [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernozem).

This repository contains code to create an infographic which highlights the natural resources of Ukraine, primarly focusing on Ukraine's agricultural outputs as well as the forested regions of the country. Overall, I hope to convey the country's natural beauty and environmental significance. If patterns that reflect the impact of the Russo-Ukrainian War come up, I will emphasize those, as well.

This is being completed as the final project for MEDS course [EDS 240: Data Visualization & Communication](https://eds-240-data-viz.github.io/).
